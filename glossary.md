| 1       | **Hardware**        | The physical components of a computer system (e.g., CPU, Monitor, Keyboard).                            |
| 1       | **Software**        | A set of instructions or programs that tells a computer what to do.                                     |
| 1       | **CPU**             | Central Processing Unit, the "brain" of the computer that executes instructions.                        |
| 1       | **RAM**             | Random Access Memory; primary, volatile memory used for active data/programs.                           |
| 1       | **ROM**             | Read-Only Memory; primary, non-volatile memory storing startup instructions.                            |
| 2       | **Bit**             | The smallest unit of data in a computer, represented as a 0 or 1.                                       |
| 2       | **Byte**            | A group of 8 bits, typically the fundamental unit for measuring data size.                              |
| 2       | **Encoding**        | A system for representing characters (letters, numbers) as binary codes (e.g., ASCII, Unicode).         |
| 3       | **Boolean Logic**   | A form of algebra dealing with two states: True (1) and False (0).                                      |
| 3       | **Logic Gate**      | An electronic circuit that performs a Boolean function (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).                            |
| 4       | **Algorithm**       | A finite set of well-defined, step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem.                 |
| 4       | **Flowchart**       | A diagrammatic representation of an algorithm using standard symbols.                                   |
| 5/6     | **Variable**        | A named location in memory used to store a data value.                                                  |
| 6       | **Type Casting**    | The process of explicitly converting data from one type to another (e.g., `int("10")`).                 |
| 8       | **Module**          | A file containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and reused.                    |
| 9       | **Iteration**       | The process of repeating a sequence of instructions, typically using `for` or `while` loops.            |
| 10      | **Slicing**         | A mechanism in Python to extract a substring or sub-sequence from a sequence (string, list, tuple).     |
| 11      | **Mutable**         | Data types whose content can be changed in place after creation (e.g., List, Dictionary).               |
| 12      | **Immutable**       | Data types whose content cannot be changed after creation (e.g., String, Tuple, int, float).            |
| 13      | **Key-Value Pair**  | The fundamental data storage structure in a dictionary, where a key maps to a value.                    |
| 14      | **Phishing**        | A cyber-attack using deceptive communication to trick users into revealing sensitive information.         |
| 14      | **Malware**         | Short for Malicious Software, designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.      |
| 14      | **Digital Footprint**| The trail of data you create while using the internet.                                                  |
| 15      | **Copyright**       | A legal right granted to the creator of an original work (e.g., software code) to control its use and distribution. |
| 15      | **Plagiarism**      | Presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own without proper acknowledgment.                      |
