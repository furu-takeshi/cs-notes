## 1. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

Legal rights granted to the creator of an original work.

*   **Copyright**: Protects original works of authorship (books, music, software code). Grants the creator exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work.
*   **Patent**: Protects an invention (a new process, machine, or design).
*   **Trademark**: Protects words, names, symbols, or devices used to identify and distinguish goods/services (e.g., company logos).

| **Plagiarism** | Presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgment. |
| **Hacking** | Unauthorized access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. |
| **Cyber Laws** | Laws designed to deal with crimes and issues related to the internet and computer systems (e.g., India's Information Technology Act). |
| **Data Privacy** | The right of an individual to control how their personal information is collected, stored, and used. |

## 3. Open Source Concepts

*   **Proprietary Software**: Software where the source code is kept secret, and users must pay for a license. (e.g., Microsoft Windows)
*   **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)**: Software where the source code is made publicly available. Users are generally free to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.
    *   **Examples**: Linux OS, Python Language.
*   **Ethical Consideration**: Open-source promotes collaboration and access to knowledge, while proprietary models protect commercial interests.
