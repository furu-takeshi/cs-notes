# Introduction to Problem Solving

## 1. Steps in Problem Solving

A systematic approach to solving problems in programming:

1.  **Analysis**: Understanding the problem, inputs, and desired outputs.
2.  **Design**: Developing the logical steps to solve the problem (Algorithm, Flowchart, Pseudocode).
3.  **Implementation**: Writing the code in a specific programming language (e.g., Python).
4.  **Testing and Debugging**: Verifying the program works correctly and fixing errors.

## 2. Tools for Design

*   **Algorithm**: A set of well-defined, step-by-step instructions to solve a particular problem.
*   **Flowchart**: A diagrammatic representation of an algorithm using standard symbols (e.g., Ovals for Start/End, Rectangles for Process, Diamonds for Decision).
*   **Pseudocode**: An informal, high-level description of the operating principle of an algorithm, using the structure of a programming language but independent of its syntax.
