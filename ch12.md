# Chapter 12: Tuples

## 1. Tuple Basics

*   **Ordered Sequence**: Elements maintain their insertion order.
*   **Immutable**: Tuples cannot be changed after creation.
*   **Creation**: Items are separated by commas, usually enclosed in parentheses `()`.
    *   **Example**: `t = (1, 'a', 3.14)`

## 2. Operations

*   Accessing and Slicing are the same as Lists and Strings.
*   Cannot use modification methods like `append()`, `remove()`, or `sort()`.
*   Can use built-in functions: `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `count()`, `index()`.
