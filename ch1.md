# Computer System Overview

## Components of a Computer System
A computer system consists of hardware (physical parts) and software (instructions). The hardware is broadly divided into the following units:
Unit|Function/Examples
-|-
Input Unit|Takes data/instructions from the user. (Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner)
Central Processing Unit (CPU)|The "brain" of the computer; executes instructions.
Memory/Storage Unit|Holds data and instructions. (RAM, ROM, Hard Drive)
Output Unit|Displays results to the user. (Monitor, Printer, Speaker)

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU has three main components:
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic operations (add, subtract) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
* Control Unit (CU): Directs and coordinates all operations within the computer system by fetching and decoding instructions.
* Registers: Small, high-speed memory locations inside the CPU for temporary storage during processing.

## Memory Units
Type|Characteristics
-|-
Primary Memory|Directly accessible by the CPU. Volatile (data lost when power is off). Examples: RAM (Random Access Memory - working memory), ROM (Read Only Memory - stores boot instructions).
Secondary Memory|Not directly accessible by the CPU. Non-volatile (data retained when power is off). Used for permanent storage. Examples: HDD, SSD, Pen Drive.

## Software
Type|Description|Examples
-|-|-
System Software|Controls and manages the computer hardware and provides a platform for application software.|Operating System (Windows, Linux), Utility Programs (Antivirus, File Compression)
Application Software|Designed to perform specific tasks for the user.|Word Processors, Web Browsers, Games
