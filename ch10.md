# String Manipulation

## 1. String Basics

-   **Sequence**: A string is an ordered sequence of characters.
-   **Immutability**: Strings cannot be changed in place (any modification creates a new string).

## 2. Accessing & Slicing

-   **Indexing**: Accessing a single character (e.g., `s[0]` for the first character).
    -   **Positive**: From `0` (left to right).
    -   **Negative**: From `-1` (right to left).
-   **Slicing**: Accessing a substring.
    -   **Syntax**: `s[start:stop:step]` (The character at the `stop` index is excluded).

## 3. Key Methods

-   `len(s)`: Returns the length.
-   `s.upper()`, `s.lower()`: Converts case.
-   `s.strip()`: Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
-   `s.find(substring)`: Returns the lowest index where the substring is found.
-   `s.replace(old, new)`: Returns a new string with all occurrences of `old` replaced by `new`.
