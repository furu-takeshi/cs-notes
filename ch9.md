# Flow of Control

## 1. Conditional Statements

Used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition:

-   `if`: Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.
-   `if-else`: Executes one block if `True` and another block if `False`.
-   `if-elif-else`: Checks multiple conditions sequentially.

## 2. Looping (Iteration)

Used to execute a block of code repeatedly:

-   **`for` loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a string, list, or range).
    -   **Syntax**: `for item in sequence:`
    -   The `range()` function is commonly used: `range(stop)`, `range(start, stop)`, `range(start, stop, step)`.
-   **`while` loop**: Executes as long as a condition is `True`.
    -   **Must-Know**: Ensure the condition eventually becomes `False` to avoid an infinite loop.

## 3. Loop Control Statements

-   `break`: Terminates the loop immediately.
-   `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.
