# Cyber Safety

Cyber safety involves protecting yourself, your data, and your devices from digital threats.

## 1. Security Threats & Malware

| Threat         | Description                                                          | Key Protection                                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virus**      | Malicious program that attaches to a file/program and replicates itself, damaging files and the system. | Antivirus software, avoiding suspicious attachments.      |
| **Spyware**    | Secretly collects user information (passwords, browsing history) without the user's knowledge. | Antivirus/Anti-spyware software, firewalls.               |
| **Phishing**   | Deceptive attempts to acquire sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card details) by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an email or communication. | Always check the sender's email address and the URL.      |
| **Trojan Horse** | Malware disguised as legitimate software. It doesn't replicate but opens a 'backdoor' for attackers. | Only download software from official sources.             |

## 2. Best Practices for Cyber Safety

*   **Strong Passwords**: Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid common words or personal information. Change them regularly.
*   **Safe Browsing**: Look for `https://` and the padlock icon in the browser address bar (indicating a secure connection). Be cautious of pop-ups and unknown links.
*   **Firewall**: A system that filters network traffic, blocking unauthorized access to your computer.
*   **Digital Footprint**: The record of all your activities on the internet. Be mindful of what you post as it is permanent.
    *   **Active**: Data you intentionally share (posts, comments).
    *   **Passive**: Data collected without your explicit knowledge (IP address, location).
*   **Data Backup**: Regularly copy important files to an external drive or cloud storage to prevent loss from hardware failure or malware.
